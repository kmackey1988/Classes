/*Declare a global variable for each of JavaScript's 5 main data types.  Each one must be commented with which variable type it is
Write a function that creates a number variable called "fVal" with function scope.
Use this variable in a math expression that also uses one of your numeric global variables
Inside the function, write an 'if' statement that checks to see if "fVal" is negative.  If it is, create a new variable inside the if statement with block scope.  (there is a keyword for this)
A comment at the bottom of the file describing the difference between global, function and block scopes.*/
